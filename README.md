# Full Stack Developer Challenge
To better gauge your skills as a full stack developer, we would like you to complete the following challenge. This will help our interviewers assess your strengths, and frame the conversation through the interview process. Take as much time as you need, however we ask that you not spend more than a few hours. 

At this time, we require you to use a **Flask & Flask-RESTful** and a **SPA framework** (reactjs, vuejs, angularjs) with **any css framework** of your choice and **any database** of your choice. If you prefer NOT using any, please provide us with reasons as to why. However, internally we use Python(flask), Bootstrap & reactjs, and it would help us to evaluate what we know and use.

## Submission Instructions
1. Fork this project on GitHub. You will need to create an account if you don't already have one
2. Complete the challenge within your fork after reading below details.
3. Push all of your changes to your fork on GitHub and submit a pull request.

## Project Description
Imagine that we wanted to improve our products by sending out a quick survey to our customers asking what they like & dislike about our products.

### What your web application must do:
1. A simple landing page that explains that we are collecting users' opinion to improve our products.
2. A form that asks for `name`, `date of birth`, `email`, `country`, `city`, `things that they like` 
 `things that they dislike` a   bout our products, passes it to the backend via API call then saves it into a database of your choice.
3. A quick thank you page at the end of a successful submission.
4. A simple admin panel that lists user entries.
 
Your application should be easy to set up, have a clear step by step instructions on how to run your submission and should run on Linux distros such as ubuntu, centos or debian. It should not require any non open-source software.

There are many ways that this application could be built; we ask that you build it in a way that showcases one of your strengths (OOP, clean interface, clean code, extensible code, high code quailty, beautiful frontend...etc). If you you enjoy front-end development, do something interesting with the interface. If you like object-oriented design, feel free to dive deeper into the domain model of this problem. We're happy to tweak the requirements slightly if it helps you show off one of your strengths.

Once you're done, please submit a paragraph or two in your `README` about what you are particularly proud of in your implementation, and why.

## Evaluation
Evaluation of your submission will be based on the following criteria. 

1. Did your application fulfill the basic requirements?
2. Did you document the method for setting up and running your application?
3. Did you follow the instructions for submission?
4. Did you style your code in a way that it's easy to read and understand?
5. Did you go above and beyond? (Did your submission surprise us?)
6. Did you maintain clean code (indentation, comments, naming conventions)

## Note
Please submit clean code with proper indentation. Understand that the first thing we do is  
read your code, not run your code. If you fail to keep consistant indentation and  
the best practices in defining your functions and variable names, chances are  
we will not need to run your code to evaluate your skills.

## What's Next?
Once when you have submitted your work we will review your submission as soon as possible. 
Please note we will only contact the selected candidates for further consideration.
We thank you for taking the time to complete this development challenge and appreciate your interest in pursuing a career with us.
